    "This module implements two classes:\n",

    "class StreamData\n",
    "class StreamReader\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Data read by the `StreamReader` from openPMD based storage is stored in 3-tuple such that its contents are:\n",
    "- `stream_cfg` node under which to look for keys.\n",
    "- `data_dict` node under which to store results for each key. `data_dict` is the where the data stored.\n",
    "- The associated record that is supposed to contain the keys. The last value is simply associated iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "`stream_cfg` reads its configuration from file `main/StreamDataReader/stream_config.json`. The `stream_config.json`\n",

    "\n",
    "This implements a thread based class \n",

    "```py\n",
    "\n",
    "class StreamBuffer\n",

    "```\n",
    "uses the `StreamReader` defined to read the data either saved locally or being streamed. Allows setting up two characterstics:\n",

    "- Whether read data locally/offline or stream in.\n",

    "This class is similar to `StreamBuffer.py` the data from a streamed output from PIConGPU. The difference that the filling and reading of buffer is handled inside this class instead of default handlers implemented in run method of Thread class in the case of `StreamBuffer.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The async part of the implementation is not exactly clear. The new versions of this buffer have been implemented in the `ModelHelpers/cINN`."
